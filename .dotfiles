For this lab i had to go into the home directory, then make a vim file to put the commands in. Then after that I used the cat command to check the file and make it into a txt file. Lastly I renamed the txt file then added my name and a description to it using the vim editor. 

syntax on
set ruler
set autoindent
set number
set ignorecase
color elflord
